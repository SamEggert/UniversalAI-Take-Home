# Document RAG System

A cloud-based document processing and query system using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with chain-of-thought reasoning.

## Step-by-Step Project Plan

### 1. Set Up LangChain Integration
- [ ] Research and familiarize yourself with LangChain documentation.
- [ ] Create a LangChain account (if required for their API or services).
- [ ] Install the LangChain library in your backend environment using `pip install langchain`.
- [ ] Explore LangChain's vector embeddings documentation to understand supported models and embeddings.
- [ ] Implement vector embedding generation for uploaded documents.
- [ ] Test embedding generation with sample documents.

### 2. Backend Development (Python)
#### Document Handling
- [ ] Parse uploaded documents into structured formats (e.g., extracting text from PDFs or Word documents).
- [ ] Handle errors for unsupported file types or corrupt files.

#### Vector Storage
- [ ] Set up a vector database (e.g., Azure Cosmos DB or FAISS) for storing embeddings.
- [ ] Integrate LangChain-generated embeddings into the vector database.
- [ ] Test vector storage and retrieval with simple queries.

#### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- [ ] Implement RAG pipeline to fetch relevant documents or passages based on a query.
- [ ] Add chain-of-thought reasoning to decompose complex queries.
- [ ] Implement language detection to support multilingual queries.
- [ ] Build intent classification for better query handling.
- [ ] Ensure response generation includes citations.
- [ ] Add error handling and logging.

### 3. Frontend Development (React)
#### Query Submission Interface
- [ ] Create a chat-like interface for users to submit queries.
- [ ] Display responses with citations in a user-friendly format.
- [ ] Add loading states and error notifications.

#### Integration
- [ ] Connect the frontend with the backend API.
- [ ] Validate data formats between frontend and backend.

### 4. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize vector search performance using FAISS or LangChain utilities.
- [ ] Implement batch processing for document uploads.
- [ ] Reduce latency for embedding generation and query responses.

### 5. Testing and QA
#### Backend
- [ ] Write unit tests for each backend component.
- [ ] Test document parsing, embedding generation, and RAG pipeline.

#### End-to-End
- [ ] Test system with various document types and sizes.
- [ ] Conduct load testing for concurrent user scenarios.
- [ ] Evaluate accuracy and relevance of RAG responses.

### 6. Documentation
- [ ] Write API documentation to describe available endpoints and usage.
- [ ] Provide usage examples and a quick start guide.
- [ ] Include performance benchmarks to showcase capabilities.
